# DNN
In this project, six different neural networks are compared, belonging to two different architectures. Each architecture is trained using three different techniques.

There are two notebook:
- **DNN_project.ipynb**: contain network definition, initialization and training;
- **DNN_analysis.ipynb**: contain the result analysis.

for each network are saved 3 file:
- **Net\<architecture_name><training_mode>_init.pt**: contain initialization of the netowork;
- **Net\<architecture_name><training_mode>_trained.pt**: contain parameters of the network after training;
- **Net\<architecture_name><training_mode>_results.csv**: contain accuracy, loss, time of each epoch
